## Hook and Rubric Documents
The hook document outlining the case study is the file labeled CS2Hook_Gerrymandering.pdf. The rubric CS2Rubric_Gerrymandering.pdf outlines the formatting, submission requirements, and final deliverables for this assignment.

Additionally, you can find the declination angle (i.e., the numeric representation of the degree of partisan gerrymandering in a state) here, which you will use to verify the results of your image analysis.
